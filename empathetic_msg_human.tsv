When something goes wrong with the product it's normal for some people to show doubt in the service and pass that on to you as a result. But it's your job to remain confident and show them they don't need to doubt us or feel worried about their issue, and that's exactly what you did! You're great at this, stick to your training and don't worry about it, ok?		They are detail-oriented and reliable but might appear distant. They tend to work carefully, but are prone to overthinking.

Honestly, they were being pretty disrespectful, but that wasn't your fault at all and had nothing to do with how you handled their ticket. You showed you know your stuff, and it's up to them to come to us when they need help. If they call back again remember it's because they need you and deep down they know you can help them.		They are detail-oriented and reliable but might appear distant. They tend to work carefully, but are prone to overthinking.

But just remember that you're serving a critical role--even if it's just for the customer to vent their frustration, your presence means they feel heard and that there's still hope their issue will get resolved.		
66b518e2880b311d8ad2dac4	667ab64e047d4032dcc8be52	1	34.0	You can't take this person's rudeness personally--they have a legitimate reason to be frustrated and they aren't mad at you, just at the system that's delayed them and given them no answers.

I know you might be tempted to go slower on purpose out of spite--certainly their tone doesn't make anyone feel inclined to rush for them--the sooner you get them out of your hair the better. It will all be worth it when you're home and have extra cash in your pocket.	The conversation takes place in the second half of the work shift.

That said, you have to spend the rest of your shift here anyway--might as well do it right; you have company policy on your side, so as long as you respond promptly and appropriately any escalation on this person's fault shouldn't blow back on you.

66b51b87880b311d8ad2dac9	667ab64e047d4032dcc8be52	4	45.0	This person wasn't very nice to you, but you can't please all of the people all of the time.

66b51bef963d2f84d71e9b99	667ab64e047d4032dcc8be52	5	31.0	This person is obviously crunched for time in terms of when his flight is, and that's been exacerbated by his long wait. It's not your fault and in the end you're the one who is going to fix the problem for him.

It must be taking a very heavy toll on you emotionally and psychologically to have to spend most of your working days apologizing on behalf of the organization to angry, disappointed, sad, and frustrated customers. I know, and understand how easily negative emotions can be projected onto you, and cause your character to be altered the wrong way. You nearly don't get paid enough for this, and I feel so sorry to see you go through that.
But do you know that you are the best part of this organization? Think about all the customers you have helped smile after their inquiries were answered and their complaints resolved. Every department counts on you to bring feedback from customers to help us improve our services, and every customer counts on you to help their emotions communicate directly to the airline. 
Without you, this institution would be a mess, and people wouldn't travel with a guaranteed great experience from the airline. In other words, you are the superhero in this organization, working tirelessly to keep it all together. Please forget about all the negativity and focus on the good that you do. Everybody recognizes your worth, and trust me, you are worth more to all of us than you think. "
