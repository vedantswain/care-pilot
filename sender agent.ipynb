    "                Complaint: I am flying from Luton to Dalaman (Turkey) next week with Monarch and am wondering whether or not to bother with online check-in. [We already have allocated seats, so as far as I can see the only extra thing that online check-in offers is that you don't have to have your boarding pass printed at the check-in desk. Things that are putting me off are: (1) I've noticed over the past couple of years that because now most people are checking in online, the queues for the online check-in desks are often actually longer than the queues for people who haven't checked in online (2) Last year we had a 12 hour flight delay - the original plane had a problem and the airline then split passengers into two groups and people who had NOT checked in online were flown out on a much earlier plane than those who had checked in online - goodness knows why.\\\n",

I got the price back and had a quick chat with hubby and we decided to go for it and book. Within about 20 mins the price had risen almost £400. I,m so angry, how can they justify this? I had a live web chat with their advisors who more or less said it boils down to supply and demand on flight seats and hotel rooms. I don,t buy that, not in such a short space of time.
