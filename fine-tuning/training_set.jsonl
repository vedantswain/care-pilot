Passengers in transit should not pay the 200.000 rp. So, for the above stated, and because it was Qatar airways the carrier collecting the money, I am requesting the refund of it as I paid it twice.

While Qantas has not had an accident/incident where people died, tarnished is the operative word for them. They are gradually whittling away any benefits at all. Recently I booked with their subsidiary, Jetstar, Sydney - Honolulu return with business options. Here, the add-ons they normally charge to go cattle are generally included. I have a cattle class Sydney-Brisbane return with them as well and that has add-on costs galore. My real beef is the dreadful Jetstar website and lack of connection with that of Daddy QANTAS. In spite of endless patience and a very fast Internet connection, the Jetstar site is woefully slow and has severe Alzheimer's! The site continues to insist that I have no booking for my international leg although I have a confirmed itinerary and a booking number: absolutely a denial that such a booking exists. A call to their customer service department took two days to get through! It kept ringing out or I got a number unreachable message. When I did connect, I was assured there was such a booking but not according to my profile. However, the domestic booking is there! Go figure! With well over 400,000 frequent flyer points, Qantas has a couple of reward options for flight redemptions but of course, taxes can be extreme so one might just as well buy a ticket anyway.

[We flew Christchurch NZL to Narita Airport, Tokyo via the Gold Coast Airport. The flights were on time going over, no issues with delays or connections. The flight was delayed an hour coming back, but apart from that we had no issues with onwards connections, lost bags etc. The planes were lovely and service great. The thing that impressed us most was regarding our request to have luggage on the way back. We had booked a while back when they had a 2:1 special (2 fly for price of 1). We booked our basic flights ex Chch. Over the next few weeks we got several emails changing details of our flight. For the most part these were tiny changes: change of terminal, flights changing times by 5-10 minutes (in our favour), however, one of the changes was canning the return flight to Chch and putting us on a flight to Auckland, then a domestic flight to Chch. We didn't have any choice but to accept this as our trip was on quite a tight timeframe. Later we decided that we wanted to have one person with 10kg baggage on the way back to allow for a few souvenirs we planned to get. When we went to do this online, we found that it would cost us $98 (which we were prepared to pay) plus $15 more because of the domestic flight we now had through the change to their scheduling. We decided to wait until the airport and ask them there to waive the $15 as it was not our choice to do that leg. The lady at the airport counter spent quite a bit of time going through our booking history, then she handed us our boarding passes and said no problem. I pulled out my cc to pay for the Narita-AKL baggage and she said there was no charge for that either. We had asked for one person to have 10kg and she loaded 15kg baggage on both our tickets for free. We thought that was pretty good and were happy with that!

I had a blanket and jacket but I was still shivering throughout the entire flight. In hindsight, I'm not sure why I didn't ask for an extra blanket - I must have been delirious with sleep... Breakfast is served about an hour before landing. It consisted of a fruit muffin, yogurt, and a box of raisins (?!). Not very filling, but oh well. IFE was average - I only watched one movie before going to sleep. The new releases were nothing to get excited about, so it may be wise to bring your own entertainment. BA85 from LHR to YVR: My experience on this flight was similar to the above, except this time I had seat 29K. This is also an exit row seat but in the second row of economy with a missing seat in front which allows you to enter the aisle by walking in front (and not over your seat mates). It was a good seat but not as good as any of the exit row seats in row 28 which just feel more spacious. This flight departed a bit late and arrived 45 minutes late at YVR. I also flew from LHR to BCN (BA486), and AMS to LHR (BA435) on their smaller planes. Both plane interiors looked brand spanking new. I managed to score exit row seats on both these fights as well which was a nice bonus even though the flights were quite short in duration. There's no IFE but they do serve a small snack and free drinks on both flights. I don't know what the snacks were as I declined them on both flights. ]Overall, a very good experience with BA. They're definitely my airline of choice when flying to, from, and within Europe, especially if I can get an exit row seat on the international flights.[ Edited: 11:28 pm, July 13, 2015]"}]}

We visited France, Greece and England. I booked and paid for 3 flights with Easy Jet prior to our departure. The first two flights were uneventful. However our last flight from Athens to London ended up blowing my holiday budget out of the water. We were booked on an Olympic Air flight out of Paros in the Greek Islands a flight that is 20 minutes in length and was scheduled to depart at 16.05pm. Our Easy Jet Connection was due to depart at 19.00 and check in closed at 18.20. Due to the late incoming plane to Paros we did not arrive in at Athens airport until 17.55pm and we were promptly transferred to the terminal by an awaiting bus and were in the terminal at 18.00. I advised my wife and children to go and retrieve the bags and I raced up to the Easy Jet counter to commence check in. By the time I got to the counter it was 18.18pm on my watch and on the clocks in the terminal but there were no Easy Jet staff at the check in at all. The next day there was an Air Traffic Controllers strike that had been scheduled and we had non-refundable accommodation and other paid activities in London. I went looking for the Easy Jet representative in the Terminal who advised that as it was at that stage, 18.21pm by her watch the flight had closed, there were no staff available and there was nothing she could do other than advise us that due to industrial action and bookings we would not be likely to get paid seats with Easy Jet for 3 days. Faced with this I looked for flights departing to London that night and found a British Airways flight due to depart at 19.10. I was advised by a BA representative that she may be able to get 5 seats but would not know until 18.40. She managed to get 5 economy seats for which I was charged in excess of EURO2500 or Australian $3557.00. I spoke to BA the next day in London and a staff member told me that I was charged adult fares for the two children under 12 and that I should be entitled to a 25% refund. The battle to do this is still going on with the BA refunds section and the initial response that I received when the matter was referred to BA customer relations was that BA only have 2 classes of economy seats adult and infant ie 2 and under. There website would suggest otherwise. I have written to Easy Jet and am awaiting a response and will detail it in this forum when it is to hand. I think the moral of this story is that allow the widest possible berth between connection if travelling on a discount carrier. Do not accept the check in closure time will be adhered to by staff of a budget carrier and make sure that you have travel insurance that covers the scenario of a missed connection, as many policies in this regard will only give you a limited amount in very limited circumstances. I will keep you all posted. ------- Sydney]"}]}

These roadworks had been ongoing for more than 2 weeks prior to the date and therefore all staff/passengers should have been aware of the possibilities of delays and allowed extra time.

I asked to be transferred through to the sales team as she was in the customer services team and seemingly in a differennt country! After being put on hold for a while an English sounding guy came on the line, asking what the problem was..at this point I'm in tears as I'm so stressed out and he tells me \"You won't lose the holiday as you're talking to me now. You called us, it's fine. Your tickets have been dispatched anyway\". He says that the price of the holiday may have gone up and didn't I get any emails from the woman who booked it for me bk in October. I haven't heard from here since the day I bloody booked it!!!!!! I tell him how I was told that the taxes would not be rising again and how I'd budgeted down to the last penny for what I believed I owed. He gave me this agents direct line telling me she'd be in tomorrow 9:00-5:30pm and that she knew more about the booking and would be able to help me. I'm so angry at this shoddy service from Travelocity. You can't go adding money onto peoples outstanding balances without informing them beforehand!!! I lost my job recently so money is tight at the moment and to say I'm still shaking with anger is not an exaggeration! I was in bloody tears to the guy on the phone. I'm so stressed out at the moment. They can't do this again can they??? They'd have the call on tape where I was told in no terms would the taxes be rising again.. I wasn't even told by the lady in India where the additional \u00a330 had come from!!!!!!!! Will be ringing the lady who booked the trip for me first thing tomorrow morning but would appreciate any advice if possible. Many thanks for reading my rant ....*and breathe*"}]}

Their luggage made it A ok but it took so long to get me a gate pass after they were checked in that we did not get to the gate in time. The problem seems to be two fold. First of all there are NOT enough agents to handle the load. Second is that you must stand in a line that is at the very end of the ticketing area and do not have a dedicated agent to deal with. So you must wait until another line is empty or another agent comes from the \"back\" to assist you. Maybe it is just Orlando and not Air Tran but I have never had any of those problems flying from Melbourne. Additionaly the security at Orlando is poorly organized and the TSA agents are in no hurry to get you to the airside on time.

I thought it best to wait 'till we all got home so we can give hopefully a balanced perspective of events. We were due to fly home on 15th April, when it all first happened from Atlanta. We were about 250 miles from the airport, just waking up in our hotel room when we heard the news on CNN, and obviously devastated. It was more the \"not knowing\" than anything else. The website (BA) told us not to go to the airport, and it was about 2.5 hours to speak to someone on the phone. We had to go and return the rental car anyway at ATL so had some hours to calm down and think a bit, rather than turn up to check in totally unaware and panic. The news in the U.S on this was fairly low key at the time from what we saw, and we got more information by logging on to UK news websites, it really felt like doom and gloom from what the media were saying. On our arrival at check in, we handed in my pre printed boarding passes to the BA check in staff, and decided just to book ourselves on the next available flight out, which was 6 days later. Again feeling devastated by the wait and potential additional expense that wasn't budgeted for (or so we thought). The kids were upset, the wife too, however \"keep calm\" I said to myself, trying to hold it all together ,as there is nothing you can do. BA check in staff were truely exceptional, along with ATL dispatchers for the flight (BA226 ATL-LHR on 15th Apr '10). Although they could not doing anything about the flight, their service went beyond the call of duty in terms of help, advice, and being put up in a hotel nearby with all meals paid for. BA, the hotel staff, ATL staff, and the British Consulate in downtown all worked together for the benefit of the passengers. All of them worked 110% to help us, and it will never be forgotten. I was aware of the other horror stories from other airlines just \"dumping\" their passengers with little more than $7 per day to survive on. We remember a group of 4/5 parent helpers looking after 20 or so kids who were representing the UK in a robotic tournament in Atlanta flying on an American airline who had to start paying out of their own pockets. I hope you got back safely if you're reading this. We also rememberd at the consulate, another passenger \"dumped\" by another European airline, with no one to talk to, speak to, or given any advice until the Consulate stepped in. There are hundreds more I know, and we are lucky to be what I think are the fortunate few who flew on BA. I'm not one to hype up BA, as I had some reservations on flying with them, but after this experience, and if I ever decide to fly again then there will only be 1 airline to choose from. I hope everyone can receive some form of recompense. Up to then my faith in British society had been strained to say the least, but this experience is something I'll never forget, that yes there are people out there who care and want to make a difference. I hope everyone out there still gets home safely and quickly."}]}

[Be very aware that when you click on accepting the terms of use this company will not compensate you for any errors they have made. Our experience is a result of this company not disclosing on their website they charge in US currency. However, looking through various sites even US based clients have had several issues regarding this company not providing compensation for legitimate complaints. I have sent the following email to the founder of Apple Leisure and the CEO and they refuse to respond. You will also notice the contact info for this company is very vague on their website. In short, we have booked vacations through many on-line companies that are ethical. THis one is not so do not expect any client support from them..... I am writing today to tell you how disappointed I am in your misleading business practices and disgusted I am with your customer support (a common thread in many reviews for your company). I shop on-line a lot and book trips through on-line travel sites so I am knowledgeable on how things work at check-out. I am from Canada and shop in the US, UK and, of course, Canada. We used Cheap Caribbean last year to book a trip and we were charged Canadian funds (funds were at par) and because of this we assumed your company charges us in our currency. There is NOTHING on the website or at checkout to indicate otherwise. For example, even when we book with Hotwire US we are quoted at checkout USD meaning the final price states clearly USD. Cheap Caribbean does not specify anywhere on the website or on our ticket voucher you charge in USD. There is nothing in your contract either to indicate you charge in USD. We were pretty shocked when we were billed $450+ more than we were invoiced for on our credit card. When I called customer care indicating I expect a refund the differance I was informed by a robotic like human ...we are a US company we charge in USD. I could not get Bobby to understand the issue is not that you charge in USD, you don't tell your customers you charge USD. A call to the supervisor was a waste of time. He could care less. The LAST think a customer wants to here is \"we are not doing anything for you\". So, as a result of this I have filed a complaint with the BBB and had several conversations with my friends and coworkers telling them how misleading this company is and all I spoke to are shocked you do not indicate what currency you charge in. Your refusal to pay back what you should not have charged in the first place will cost you a lot of future business. Your lack of action speaks volumes about your business practices (shady) and you lack of interest in customer satisfaction. Also, you may want to have a supervisor train your service reps. When asked ``How are you`the response of `I am okay`is not professional at all. In addition, perhaps educate your staff that a .com company does not indicate you are US based. I work for a Canadian based company with a .com site. Then again, we are ethical and clearly indicate currency charged on our invoices.]"}]}
