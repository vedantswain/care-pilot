1. Incidents: `phase1_scenarios.tsv`:
    - 3 scenario per domain per category
    - Each row involves the following:
      - `ID` : 1-45 unique identifiers
      - `Domain` : `mobile-device, airlines, hotel`
      - `Category` : `Product, Service, Pricing, Policy, Resolution`
      - `Initial Complaint` : Initial complaint by the customer

      - `Follow-up Complaint 1`: Customer follow-up
      - `Support Agent Response 2`: Response by the support agent
      - `Follow-up Complaint 2`: Customer follow-up

To generate a reframing for any incident, use the following:
```python
from agents import mAgentER

emo_agent = mAgentER()

chat_history = [
   incident_row['Initial Complaint'], 
   incident_row['Support Agent Response 1'], 
   incident_row['Follow-up Complaint 1'], 
   incident_row['Support Agent Response 2']
]
reply = incident_row['Follow-up Complaint 2']
response_cw_emo = emo_agent.invoke({'complaint':reply, "chat_history": chat_history})
```

2. Participants:`prolific_demographic_phase1.csv`
    - Details of prolific participants
    - `Participant id`: Unique identifier for Prolific ID
    - `Status`: Only keep 116 participants with status `AWAITING REVIEW`, other participants are screened out or rejected
    - Other demographic details for data transparency

3. Writing task: `summative_writing.tsv`
   - Only retains responses for the 116 participants
   - `incident_id`: Unique identifier for the incident matches `ID` in `phase1_scenarios.tsv`
   - `scenario_num`: 0-5; no-context [0,1], behavior context [2,3], personality context [4,5]
   - `dat3`: Thought generated by the participant on vieiwing the incident
   - `dat4`: Empathetic reframing message written by participant
   - `context_behav`: Randomly assigned out of 3 possible contexts for [2,3]. Null for others.
   - `context_pers`: Assigned by participant self-report out of 3 possible contexts for [4,5]. Null for others.
