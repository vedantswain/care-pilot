Sentiment analysis using two different approaches.
Approach 1: NLTK (traditional)
Approch 2: Transformers (Hugging-Face)
Approch 3: TextBlob

I couldn't find specific theories about the range of scores, 
but transformers can mainly identify positive, neutral, and negative sentiments. 
To increase the diversity of my evaluation, I added the following code:
